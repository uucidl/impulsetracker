Impulse Tracker is written in Borland's Turbo Assembler and can be built with its version 4.0. However it is compiled with the compatibility flag /ut310 indicating that it's really targetting Turbo Assembler 3.10

Impulse Tracker's main compilation variables are stored in @file{SWITCH.INC} which is included by all other source files.

@section: @file{SWITCH.INC}

This file contains various variables. Some of them use = and some of them use EQU.

@quote{@src{TASMQR94}
  = Ideal, MASM 
  name = expression 
  Defines or redefines a numeric equate.
}

@quote{@src{TASMQR94}
  EQU Ideal, MASM 
  name EQU expression 
  Defines name to be a string, alias, or numeric equate containing the result 
  of evaluating expression .
}

The only item using EQU defines a numeric variable, so it seems we could refactor it to use = instead.
